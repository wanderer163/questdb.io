description: Introducing QuestDB Java ILP Client
---
## Quickstart
Add a QuestDB as a dependency to your build project:
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs"
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem"
import { RemoteRepoExample } from '@theme/RemoteRepoExample'

<Tabs defaultValue="maven" values={[
{ label: "Maven", value: "maven" },
{ label: "Gradle", value: "gradle" },
]}>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

<TabItem value="maven">

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.questdb</groupId>
    <artifactId>questdb</artifactId>
    <version>6.4.3</version>
</dependency>
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="gradle">

```text
compile group: 'org.questdb', name: 'questdb', version: '6.4.3'
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The code bellow creates an instance of a client, configures it to connect to a QuestDB server running on localhost
on a TCP port 9009. Then it sends two rows, each with one [symbol](/docs/concept/symbol/), long column and one string column. It instructs the QuestDB 
server to assign a timestamp by using a local wall-clock.

<RemoteRepoExample name="ilp" lang="java" header={false} />

## Example with TLS and Authentication enabled
This sample configures a client to use TLS encryption for a connection to a QuestDB server. It also instructs
the client to authenticate.

<RemoteRepoExample name="ilp-auth-tls" lang="java" header={false} />

This configuration also works with [QuestDB Cloud](https://questdb.io/cloud/). If you are using a self-managed QuestDB
with [authentication enabled](/docs/reference/api/ilp/authenticate) then `authToken` is the `d` portion of a JWK. 

## General usage pattern
1. Create a client instance via `Sender.builder()`.
2. Use `table(CharSequence)` to select a table for inserting a new row.
3. Use `symbol(CharSequence, CharSequence)` to add all symbols. You must add symbols before adding other column type.
4. Use the following options to add all the remaining columns:
    * `stringColumn(CharSequence, CharSequence)`
    * `longColumn(CharSequence, long)`
    * `doubleColumn(CharSequence, double)`
    * `boolColumn(CharSequence, boolean)`
    * `timestampColumn(CharSequence, long)`

5. Use `at(long)` or `atNow()` to set a designated timestamp. 
6. Optionally: You can use `flush()` to send locally buffered data into a server.
7. Go to the step no. 2 to start a new row.
8. Use `close()` to dispose the Sender after you no longer need it.

## Designated timestamp considerations
The following options determine how a [designated timestamp](/docs/concept/designated-timestamp/) is assigned:

* `atNow()` automatically assigns a timestamp based on a server wall-clock upon receiving a row.
*  `at(long)` assigns a specific timestamp.

The code samples above use QuestDB to assign timestamp automatically: `atNow()` instructs the server to assign a timestamp by using a local wall-clock. 
To assign a specific timestamp, use `at(long)` instead of `atNow()`. 

:::note

QuestDB works best when rows are ingested in a chronological order. This means rows with older timestamps are ingested
before rows with newer timestamps. Receiving out-of-order data can have a performance impact.
See [Out-of-order commit lag](/docs/guides/out-of-order-commit-lag) for more information.

:::

Please note that the client does not interpret the timestamp in any way. It merely passes the timestamp
to a server, and it is up to a server to interpret the timestamp. 
The default behavior of a QuestDB server is to treat the designated timestamp as a number of nanoseconds since 1st Jan 1970 UTC. See [Timestamps](/docs/develop/insert-data/#timestamps) for more details.   

:::caution


By default, QuestDB's engine treats a designated timestamp as nanoseconds, but this does not mean that `System.nanoTime()`  can be used to get the current time and pass it to `at(long)`. 
`System.nanoTime()` is only useful for measuring elapsed time,  and it is not related to any notion of system or wall-clock time.   

:::



## Other considerations
- The Sender is not thread-safe. For multiple threads to send data to QuestDB, each thread should have its own Sender instance.
An object pool can also be used to re-use Sender instances.
- The Sender instance has to be closed after it is no longer in use. The Sender implements the `java.lang.AutoCloseable`
interface, and therefore the [try-with-resource](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html) pattern can be used to ensure that the Sender is closed. 
- A client buffers row data internally and sends them to a server in batches when the buffer is full. This improves
performance significantly, but it also means that during a period of quiescence, some written
rows may be retained in the buffer and are not sent to a server until the buffer are full. 
- The method `flush()` can be called to force sending the internal buffer to a server, even when the buffer is not full yet.

  
## Configuration
The client offers a builder API to configure all supported options. See `Sender.builder()`.

## Limitations
The client supports TCP only. It does not support UDP as transport.
